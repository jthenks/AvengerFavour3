This program is the third iteration of AvengerFavour1. In this version, singly linked lists (and arraylists from version 1) were replaced with binary search trees. This
replacement was for practice with different data structures with different time complexities. 

This program searches through text files to locate keywords. The keywords in this case are Avengers (character name, or alias). This program then creates Avenger objects
for each character and tracks the amount of times they are mentioned. Avengers are then added to multiple different binary search trees and sorted based on the desired 
comparison algorithms.

This was a university assignment that was submitted as a .jar file for easy output comparison. There is a placeholder in the java files that allows for manual .txt file 
selection.

This program was created in a team of three. My personal contribution was the creation of the Avenger class, all three comparators, the logic behind all comparator use within 
the A3 class, and minor changes to the BST class.
